    //connects the corresponding spring systems into a general system.
    //- Add a method that connects to the obtained system of spring a body of unit mass
    //and computes its oscillations.
    //- Add a method that calculates the frequency amplitudes of the oscillations using the
    //implemented Fourier transform.
    //- Add a method that determines the decimal value of the original binary sequence
    //using the computed frequency amplitudes.
