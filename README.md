# Mechanics-Project


The project aims at design and simulation of a mechanical converter that converts
binary representation of a number into its value in the decimal numeral system. The input
consists of 8 signals representing bits – 1 if a signal is recorded, and 0 – if the signal is missing.
The device generates a spring oscillation the frequency of which corresponds to the magnitude
of the recorded input.
